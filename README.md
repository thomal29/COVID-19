## The Search for COVID-19 datasets
I looked at the Harvard Dataverse website and browsed the COVID-19 data to begin to formulate a hypothesis. 
<br/>
The first things I was interested in looking at the most recent data they had. I was immediately interested in was the US COVID daily cases by state, county, and metropolitan level. Except, at this time I am unsure how to view the data on my computer. It would be interesting to see how things are progressing. But unsure what hypotheses I could ask. 
<br/>
The other thing that I am interested in is the "Policies and Regulations" dataset. 
It involves both from the Chinese government, global organizations, westerrn countries, etc. This isn't as recent as the first dataset I mentioned. This one is updated throgh July 12th. The first set was updated through July 14th (yesterday). This has better options for hypotheses. I could compare and see how different areas are dealing with this issue. For instance, China was the first place this showed up. So they were dealing with it before anyone else- perhaps other countries are 'following in their footsteps' with things.
